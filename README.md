## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

### Dataset

We have selected the Better Life Index (BLI) dataset for our project. The Better Life Index is an initiative by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) aimed at measuring well-being beyond GDP by comparing countries across 11 key dimensions of quality of life. These dimensions include housing, income, jobs, community, education, environment, governance, health, life satisfaction, safety, and work-life balance. Each dimension is represented by one or more quantitative indicators, which collectively allow us to derive a comprehensive well-being profile for each country.

The dataset consists of 11 main indicators composed of 20 sub-indicators, calculated through averaging and normalization processes. The data provided by the OECD originates from official OECD statistics and reputable national data sources, ensuring high reliability and credibility. Approximately 80% of the indicators are regularly published by the OECD, with additional data sourced from internationally recognized institutions, including national statistical offices, United Nations Statistics, and the Gallup World Poll.

The BLI dataset covers all 38 OECD member countries, which predominantly consist of developed economies, as well as a few emerging economies, including Brazil, Russia, and South Africa. While the dataset is comprehensive within this scope, it notably excludes most developing countries, given its focus on OECD nations. Nevertheless, the covered countries provide a robust representation of diverse economic, social, and governance contexts relevant to comparative analyses of well-being.

The dataset is maintained rigorously by the OECD, ensuring its completeness, accuracy, and consistency. The data is openly accessible through OECD’s Better Life Index website and OECD’s data portals, and it can easily be exported in widely-used formats such as CSV or JSON. Due to its careful curation by OECD experts, the dataset requires minimal preprocessing or data cleaning.

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
>
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
>
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
