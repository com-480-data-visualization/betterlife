OECD themselves have made multiple different visualizations for their own data, such as an interactive dashboard allowing users to weight 11 well-being dimensions, a mapping of BLI indicators geographically, and many different charts. esearchers have leveraged OECD BLI data to analyze well-being through composite indicators, regression models, and multivariate techniques, often linking metrics to economic equity or development . Some have reimagined aggregation methods such as hierarchical weighting to align with public priorities

We plan on using OECD's own visualizations as a source of inspiration for our project. In particular, the interactive dashboard allows users to generate their own personalized rankings of country performance. We believe that this style of user-driven storytelling will be good to capture user's attention. In addition, their use of flowers to visualize the 11 well-being dimensions allows them to simplify the multivariate data without losing nuance. The geographic mapping of BLI indicators also offers a spatial lens to compare outcomes. These qualities are things we wish to emulate in our project. By blending modular interactivity and intuitive visual metaphors, we aim to empower users to explore well-being trends through their own priorities, in order to balance clarity with depth. None of us have used this dataset before in any previous works or personal projects.
